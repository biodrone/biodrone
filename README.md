# 👋 Hi there!

I'm a DevOps enthusiast passionate about infrastructure automation and data sovereignty.

Currently, I've co-founded [DataSolace](https://datasolace.com), where I help businesses achieve their automation goals.

Beyond work, you'll find me on the trails 🚵‍♂️ downhill mountain biking, practicing 🎯 archery, tending to my 🌱 garden, or experimenting in the 👨‍🍳 kitchen.
